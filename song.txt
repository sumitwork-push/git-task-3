Out of focus
Didn't take a second to notice
Now we're separated by oceans, vast
Couldn't make this last

You know I spent some time in Hollywood tryna find
Something to get the thought of you and I off my mind
So tell me honey, oh, when you're just a step away from falling apart
Do you ever feel like going back to the start?


I wish I'd have stayed
'Cause love can find a way to make your feet run heavy
Make your heart run steady
Then it breaks
So I'm praying that you're feeling the same
